This is the whole UI.
Here I have used the display: grid property to align all the images. First, the outermost container is divided into three rows, the 2nd row is divided into two columns, and the last row is divided into three columns. The second row has two columns, the first column is futher divided into two row and each row is divided into two more columns and the second column of second row is further divided into two columns.<br>
Then used the IMG tag to get the image in each column and set its height width to 100% but because of this images were overflowing so to stop this used overflow: hidden property.<br>

In the navbar used display: flex property and justify-content:space-around to align the items.
